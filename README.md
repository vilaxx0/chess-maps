# ChessMaps - Chess Board Finder

A native Android mobile app developed in Kotlin and Android SDK that helps users locate public chess boards. The app uses the Google Maps API to display the locations of the chess boards. It also includes a chess clock that utilizes a WebView to render a website with chess clock functionality. Firebase was used as the backend to manage authentication and location data.

## Technologies

The following technologies were used in the development of this project:

- Kotlin
- Android SDK
- Google Maps API
- Firebase
- LiveData

LiveData was used to ensure that the app remains responsive and up-to-date with the latest data of the chess boards locations. Whenever a new chess board location is added or removed, LiveData triggers the UI update, and the list of chess board locations is updated automatically.
