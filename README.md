# ChessMaps - Chess Board Finder

A native Android mobile app developed in Kotlin and Android SDK that helps users locate public local chess boards. The app uses the Google Maps API to display the locations of the chess boards. It also includes a chess clock that utilizes a WebView to render a website with chess clock functionality. Firebase was used as the backend to manage location data, and authorized users can add and remove locations.
